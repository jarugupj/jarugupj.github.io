## Project Overview  
This individual project focused on building a professional front-end website and integrating it with public APIs using JavaScript and web technologies covered in the WAPH course. I deployed the site on GitHub Pages and structured it as a real-world profile to showcase my education, experience, and skills. I also applied key techniques from Lab 2, such as using jQuery, handling cookies, and integrating public APIs with disclaimers.

### Outcomes:
- Strengthened skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (both vanilla and jQuery)
- Learned how to fetch and render data from third-party APIs
- Practiced managing cookies for dynamic user experiences
- Understood web deployment using GitHub Pages

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Professional Profile Website
- Created a fully responsive profile page using Bootstrap 5 for layout and components.
- Included personal bio, headshot, resume download, project showcases, education, and experience.
- Designed with employer targeting in mind, including clean UI and content emphasis.

---

### Task 2: JavaScript Functionalities

1. Show/Hide Email  
- A button toggles my email using an external function in `script.js`.

2. Digital Clock  
- Used `setInterval()` with `Date()` object to continuously update the current time.

3. Analog Clock  
- Leveraged provided `clock.js` script to render a canvas-based analog clock.

4. Greeting Based on Time  
- A greeting message (Good Morning / Afternoon / Evening) dynamically displays based on current system time.

---

### Task 3: Use of jQuery and One More JavaScript Library
- jQuery: Used for Joke API integration and DOM manipulation.
- Moment.js: Used for parsing and formatting timestamps in cookie-based greetings.

---

### Task 4: Web API Integration

1. JokeAPI  
- URL: https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any?type=single  
- Fetches and updates a new joke every 60 seconds using jQuery.  
- Disclaimer added: Notes that the content comes from a public API and is not moderated by me.

2. XKCD Comic API  
- URL: https://xkcd.com/info.0.json  
- Uses `fetch()` with a CORS proxy to render the latest comic and title.  
- Disclaimer added under the image stating that content comes from a third-party source.

---

### Task 5: JavaScript Cookies
- Used `setCookie()` and `getCookie()` functions to track user's last visit.
- Shows:
  - "Welcome to my homepage for the first time!" for new visitors.
  - "Welcome back! Your last visit was..." for returning users with formatted timestamps.

---

## Final Thoughts
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
- Real-world web deployment and resume building
- Dynamic JavaScript interaction using libraries
- Responsible use of external APIs with user-facing disclaimers
- Cookie-based personalization of the web experience

This assignment helped me synthesize everything from Lab 2 and turn it into a polished and functional portfolio website.
